# Authentication Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Supabase authentication in the Optiqo Dashboard application, including the migration from custom API-based authentication to Supabase's built-in authentication system.

## Problem Statement

The initial authentication implementation had several issues:
- Users could sign up/in but the app didn't recognize authentication status
- Custom API endpoints were used instead of Supabase's built-in authentication
- Manual profile management instead of leveraging Supabase's reactive user state
- Complex cookie checking and manual session management
- Authentication state wasn't properly synchronized across components
- **Email confirmation was not enforced** - users could access the app without confirming their email
- **Profile creation API had database schema mismatches** causing signup failures
- **Error handling in server routes was inconsistent** leading to unclear error messages

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **useAuth Composable** (`composables/useAuth.ts`)
2. **Auth Middleware** (`middleware/auth.ts`)
3. **App Initialization** (`app.vue`)
4. **Profile Creation API** (`server/api/auth/create-profile.post.ts`)
5. **UI Components** (Login, Signup, AppLayout, Email Confirmation)
6. **Email Confirmation Flow** (`pages/signup/confirm-email.vue`, `pages/auth/callback.vue`)
7. **Magic Link Authentication** (Passwordless sign-in and sign-up)

```

## Implementation Details

### 1. useAuth Composable

**Key Changes:**
- Added Supabase integration using `useSupabaseClient()` and `useSupabaseUser()`
- Replaced custom API calls with Supabase's built-in methods
- Added reactive user state management
- Implemented proper error handling with success/error messages
- Added profile creation during signup
- Added user watcher for automatic profile loading

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Reactive user state
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const isAuthenticated = computed(() => !!user.value)

// Profile management
const userProfile = ref<UserProfile | null>(null)
const loadUserProfile = async () => { /* ... */ }

// Authentication methods
const signUp = async (email, password, firstName, lastName, role, organizationName) => { /* ... */ }
const signIn = async (email, password) => { /* ... */ }
const signOut = async () => { /* ... */ }

// Magic link authentication
const signInWithMagicLink = async (email) => { /* ... */ }
const signUpWithMagicLink = async (email, firstName, lastName, role, organizationName) => { /* ... */ }

// Email confirmation
const resendConfirmationEmail = async (email) => { /* ... */ }
```

### 2. Auth Middleware

**Simplified Logic:**
- Uses Supabase's `useSupabaseUser()` instead of custom profile fetching
- Removed manual cookie checking
- Added database validation for security
- Cleaner, more reliable authentication checks

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to, from) => {
  const user = useSupabaseUser()
  const supabase = useSupabaseClient()
  
  if (!user.value) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
  
  // Validate user exists in database
  try {
    const { data: profile, error } = await supabase
      .from('profiles')
      .select('user_id')
      .eq('user_id', user.value.id)
      .single()
    
    if (error) {
      await supabase.auth.signOut()
      return navigateTo('/login')
    }
  } catch (err) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

### 3. App Initialization

**Simplified Structure:**
- Removed manual authentication initialization
